# Findings
This page lists findings while working with Electrolux/AEG electric/induction cooktop/hob devices.

## Disclaimers
To the extent permitted by law I take no responsibility for any damage caused by following advice in this repository. You do everything on your own risk.

## Opening device
Tools you might need:
 * flat screwdriver for main hooks,
 * torx screwdriver for power connection box.

Suggested opening procedure:
 * turn the device upside down,
 * unhook all the hooks on the left, front and right side of the hob - there is no need to anything on the back side - it will act like a hinge,
 * before opening the device turn the device to normal position
 * lift the glass and take out the user interface board
