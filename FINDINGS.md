# Findings
This page lists findings while working with Electrolux/AEG electric/induction cooktop/hob devices.

## Disclaimers
To the extent permitted by law I take no responsibility for any damage caused by following advice in this repository. You do everything on your own risk.

## Opening device
Tools you might need:
 * flat screwdriver for main hooks,
 * torx screwdriver for power connection box.

Suggested opening procedure:
 * turn the device upside down,
 * unhook all the hooks on the left, front and right side of the hob - there is no need to anything on the back side - it will act like a hinge,
 * before opening the device turn the device to normal position
 * lift the glass and take out the user interface board

## Hardware interface
The Main Power Board is connected to User Interface board using 3 wires labelled as GND, 5V and BUS. If you need a replacement, you can buy one [here](https://north.pl/karta/wiazka-kabli-do-plyty-indukcyjnej-do-electrolux-civ634-nk4,7EK-0E-C2M2-S0M.html). The cable uses Stocko Contact connectors [7234](https://www.stocko-contact.com/en/products-connector-system-pitch-2.5-mm-eco-tronic-mf-7234.php) (MPB side, keyed) and [7238](https://www.stocko-contact.com/en/products-connector-system-pitch-2.5-mm-eco-tronic-mf-7238.php) (UIB side, latched by socket). What we can conclude is that we have single wire for both TX and RX.
